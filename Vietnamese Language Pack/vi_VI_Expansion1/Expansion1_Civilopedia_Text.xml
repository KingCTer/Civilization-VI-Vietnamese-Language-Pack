The warmonger penalty is also modified by the kind of war you declare. In most cases, declaring war and capturing an enemy city will give you that era’s warmonger penalty, and razing a city will give you three times that era’s warmonger penalty. Certain Casus Belli (see the section on Casus Belli under Diplomacy) may modify these warmonger penalties, reducing them for certain actions, or making them more expensive.

If pressure from your own [ICON_Citizen] Citizens outweighs pressure from other civilizations, the city’s Loyalty will increase (up to +20 per turn). If other civilizations’ pressure is stronger, the city’s Loyalty will decrease (down to -20 per turn). Each [ICON_Citizen] Citizen exerts a base pressure of 1, but it can be modified. For example, [ICON_Citizen] Citizens in a Capital city exert an additional 1 pressure. Golden and Heroic Ages add 0.5 for all [ICON_Citizen] Citizens, while Dark Ages subtract 0.5. This [ICON_Citizen] Citizen pressure affects cities within 9 tiles, but is 10% less effective per tile distant.</Text>

Intelligence agents are often trained to look for dissenters in search of support, make contact, and help those groups become more effective than they would have been with their own resources. This is usually with the intent of distracting or undercutting the policies and practices of the target government. There is even a term of art for an intelligence officer skilled in this practice: The agent provocateur. </Text>

			<Text>Josef Stalin is said to have coined the phrase “Quantity has a quality all its own,” but that hasn’t stopped military forces throughout the ages from trying to get their hands on the best-quality tools of warfare and training that they can. Beginning with the Egyptian chariot archer in antiquity, the most effective troops of an era often required expensive equipment and long training to achieve their effects. The French knight of the high Middle Ages is another example, the result of superior equipment and long training. Come to the present day and the small teams of special operations troops in the field, backed by the high technology of airstrikes, drones, and battlefield surveillance. Sometimes quality of equipment and training is the difference between victory and defeat.</Text>

			<Text>Traditionally the opposite political-philosophical pole from individualism, collectivism emphasizes shared labor and property and identity with an ingroup. It can be hierarchical (where individuals are praised in terms of their ability to fit within the hierarchy) or more lateral (where equality between individuals in the group is emphasized.) Various collectivist economic and social experiments have been conducted through the ages, with varying degrees of success. The forced collectivization of Soviet farms during the 1920s was an unmitigated disaster. The ubuntu theology movement of South Africa informed that country’s Truth and Reconciliation Committee and the dismantling of the Apartheid system. The advantages and perils of collective action are still hotly debated, and likely will be for some time to come.</Text>

			<Text>Like individuals, nations adhere to certain political norms to maintain smooth and regular functioning between each other. A nation may choose to ignore those norms to gain some advantage, and when this is done repeatedly or flagrantly, the nation is branded a “rogue state.” This often results in political isolation for the regime, but it may allow the renegade nation to get away with what it wants, as the costs of punishing the rogue state may be higher than the community of nations is willing to pay. Rogue states may be complete political pariahs, or they may have a small handful of patron nations willing to prop them up (sometimes a failed rogue state is more dangerous than a stable rogue state.) The rest of the world finds them exasperating at best, and an unpleasant reminder of the fragility of diplomatic norms. </Text>

			<Text>The free enterprise system sometimes gives rise to individuals who, through determination, ruthlessness, guile, force, insight, dumb luck, and frequently less scrupulous methods come to exercise outsize force on business and industry. The appellation “robber baron” previously applied to nobles of the Holy Roman Empire who used their lands as a base for predatory practices, and went on to be applied to men like the Carnegies, Rockefellers, Stanfords, Cookes, and Dukes of the Gilded Age business world. Eventually public outrage compelled governments to rein in their practices, and many of these barons used portions of their immense fortunes to rehabilitate their image with philanthropic works. </Text>
